## OLD This example requires input files to be generated on CHARMM-GUI.org, using Lys.pdb. Because these input files are large, I haven't stored them here. 
This example requires input files to be generated by the quickmd plugin in vmd 
See tutorial notes for walk-through 

After input files are created, submit run.bash
sbatch run.bash 

After job successfully completes, an MD.dcd file should be generated and a msd.dat file (from cpptraj) should be found

Run python MSD.py to generate rms analyses (will create a msd.png file)
