## OLD This example requires input files to be generated on CHARMM-GUI.org, using Lys.pdb. Because these input files are large, I haven't stored them here. 
This example requires input files to be generated by the quickmd plugin in vmd 
See tutorial notes for walk-through 

After input files are created, submit holly.bash
sbatch holly.bash 

After job successfully completes, an MD.dcd file should be generated and a msd.dat file (from cpptraj) should be found

Run python MSD.py to generate rms analyses (will create a msd.png file) 


Note: use the subdirectory aa to get pdb files for each amino acid that are compliant with QuickMD 



To generate without quickmd
Navigate to the ./aa directory and edit the prep.tcl to reflect your amino acid of choice. The script is currently written for lys. 
module load NAMD
psfgen < prep.tcl

In the same directory, you will see a run.conf file that uses fin.psf/pdb. If your output file from the tcl script is called fin, you're all set. Otherwise update the name in run.conf

namd2 run.conf

Note: most likely you'll want to solvate the protein, add ions, etc. In this case, I'd strongly recommend following the NAMD tutorial at http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/namd-tutorial-html/node4.html, which will give additional suggests on setting up your structure as well as creating/running the appropriate run files for equilibration and minimization.
