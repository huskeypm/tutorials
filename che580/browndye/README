This BD tutorial simulates the association between the N-domain of CaM and pCaN, the 
corresponding pdb structures of the two parts are extracted from PDB 4Q5U


Before submitting the job (sbatch holly.bash), you should generate the .pqr files based on 
the two pdb files by typing the following commands in the terminal:
-----------------------
module load pdb2pqr/2.1.1
pdb2pqr --ff=amber CaM-N.pdb CaM-N.pqr
pdb2pqr --ff=amber pCaN.pdb pCaN.pqr
------------------------

(bug on one of the installations somewhere)


After this step is done, submit the holly.bash script
